This is a "hello world" example website for the [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package. The theme was forked from [@jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme](https://github.com/jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme) and modified by [Yihui Xie](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-lithium).

Here, I will try some math expressions:
  $$ \mathbf{c} = \mathbf{a} \wedge \mathbf{b} $$
