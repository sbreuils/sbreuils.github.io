## Digital geometry and geometric algebra

This part of my research aims at exploring digital geometry with geometric algebra. In particular, we focus on 2D bijective digitized reflections and rotations. We first studied the digitization through geometric algebra, we characterized the set of bijective digitized reflections in the plane.  We derived new bijective digitized rotations as compositions of bijective digitized reflections since any rotation is represented as the composition of two reflections. We also compared them with those obtained through geometric transformations by computing their distributions.
