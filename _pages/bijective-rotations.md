## Overview
Here you can find some useful precomputed tables of bijective rotation approches. Approaches that require precomputed table are
- CBDR (Composition of Bijective Digitized Reflections)
- OTC (Optimal Transport by Circles)


## CBDR tables
For CBDR, you can find below some

- [n = 4 , kmax = 30](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Vw9uO_RibArFh1nv5EUxLopewHGQQ_DF/view?usp=sharing) 
- [n = 2 , kmax = 30](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j23yKVH-L5xIwdxm3UQ1byYzTWS-OYBK/view?usp=drive_link) 

## OTC tables
For OTC, you can find below some links for different ring's width:
