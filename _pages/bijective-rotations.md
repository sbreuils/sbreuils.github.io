## Overview
Here you can find some useful precomputed tables of bijective rotation approches. Approaches that require precomputed table are
- CBDR (Composition of Bijective Digitized Reflections)
- OTC (Optimal Transport by Circles)


## CBDR tables
For CBDR, you can find below some
- [n = 2 , kmax = 15](https://sbreuils.github.io/tables/CBDRTable_4_30.txt) 
- [n = 4 , kmax = 30](https://sbreuils.github.io/tables/CBDRTable_4_30.txt) 
- [n = 2 , kmax = 30](https://sbreuils.github.io/tables/CBDRTable_2_30.txt) 

## OTC tables
For OTC, you can find below some links for different ring's width:
- [width = 2](https://sbreuils.github.io/tables/OT-2-circles-l2.txt) 
- [width = 3](https://sbreuils.github.io/tables/OT-3-circles-l2.txt) 
- [width = 4](https://sbreuils.github.io/tables/OT-4-circles-l2.txt)
